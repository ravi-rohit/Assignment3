            Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation
            of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking
            order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or
            roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
            established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and
            injury.[19] When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in
            a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behavior may also be observed in mother hens
            to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.
